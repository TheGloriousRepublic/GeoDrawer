# GeoDrawer
A simple tool for drawing geometric shapes and calculating properties

## Introduction
GeoDrawer is a tool designed for doing geometric calculations with a simple, easy-to-use interface. It is designed for both students and mathematicians (with a "Standard" and "Advanced" mode (To Be Implemented)). It supports basic algebra and geometry, with plans to implement topics like Calculus, Statistics, and Probability.

GeoDrawer allow the user to do a wide variety of geometric functions, including graphing functions, drawing objects (points, lines, and shapes) and finding related figures and values.

GeoDrawer is planned to allow for useful features outside of just being a high-level calculator, such as a simple, customized scripting engine and allowing for extensions to be used.
